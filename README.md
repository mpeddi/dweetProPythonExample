# dweetProPythonExample
Example python code for using dweetPro with an RPi board.

The dweetProExample.py code is free to use as an example for connecting an RPi to the dweetPro.io system.
This code sets up the RPi board with a motor shield, imports the necessary libraries, and then spins a motor every 30 seconds.

After the motor is spun the RPi notes the time and sends the timestamp to dweetPro.

That timestamp can then be visualized in a freeboard dashboard.
